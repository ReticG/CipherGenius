name: Hash_DRBG
full_name: Hash-Based Deterministic Random Bit Generator
category: random_number_generator
description: |
  Hash_DRBG is a deterministic random bit generator specified in NIST SP 800-90A.
  It uses cryptographic hash functions (SHA-2, SHA-3) to generate pseudorandom
  bits from a seed value without requiring block cipher operations.

parameters:
  hash_function: [SHA-256, SHA-512, SHA-384, SHA-512/256]
  seed_length: [440, 888]
  reseed_interval: 2^48
  output_block_length: [256, 512]

implementation_notes: |
  - Requires secure entropy source for seeding
  - Simpler than CTR_DRBG (no block cipher needed)
  - Good choice for constrained environments
  - SHA-256 recommended for most applications
  - SHA-512 for higher security requirements
  - Must implement proper reseeding mechanisms
  - Reseed after no more than 2^48 requests
  - Use at least 256 bits of entropy for initial seed
  - More portable than CTR_DRBG
