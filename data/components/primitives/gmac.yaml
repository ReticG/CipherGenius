description: |
  GMAC is a MAC algorithm based on GCM mode. It provides authentication without
  encryption and can be computed in parallel.

implementation_notes: |
  - Authentication part of GCM mode
  - Highly parallelizable
  - Excellent hardware performance
  - Must never reuse nonce with same key
  - Used in IPsec and TLS
  - Often implemented with PCLMULQDQ instruction
