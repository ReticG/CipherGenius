description: |
  Serpent is a symmetric block cipher and AES finalist designed for maximum security.
  It uses 32 rounds (compared to AES's 10/12/14) providing exceptional security margin.

parameters:
  block_size: 128
  key_size: [128, 192, 256]
  rounds: 32

implementation_notes: |
  - Highest security margin among AES finalists
  - 32 rounds provides exceptional resistance to cryptanalysis
  - Slower than AES but extremely secure
  - Excellent choice for long-term data protection
