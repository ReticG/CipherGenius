implementation_notes: |
  - Official NIST FIPS 204 standard (standardized Dilithium)
  - FIPS-approved for federal government use
  - Primary NIST recommendation for post-quantum signatures
  - Three parameter sets:
    * ML-DSA-44 (128-bit security) - general purpose
    * ML-DSA-65 (192-bit security) - NIST RECOMMENDED
    * ML-DSA-87 (256-bit security) - maximum security
  - Fast signing and verification
  - Moderate signature sizes (2.4-4.6 KB)
  - Excellent software and hardware performance
  - Can be used in hybrid mode with Ed25519/Ed448
  - Recommended for immediate post-quantum migration
  - Suitable for TLS, PKI, code signing, email
  - Best choice for most applications
  - Good balance of security, performance, and size
  - Preferred over SLH-DSA for performance-sensitive applications
