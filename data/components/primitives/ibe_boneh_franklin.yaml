description: |
  Boneh-Franklin Identity-Based Encryption is a public-key encryption system where
  any string (email address, name, etc.) can serve as a public key. A trusted
  authority generates corresponding private keys. Based on bilinear pairings on
  elliptic curves and the Bilinear Diffie-Hellman problem.

  curve: [BN254, BLS12-381, BLS12-377]
  key_size: 256
  pairing_type: Type-3
  security_parameter: [128, 256]

properties:
  - identity_based
  - pairing_based
  - chosen_ciphertext_secure

implementation_notes: |
  - Requires trusted Private Key Generator (PKG)
  - PKG has master secret key and can derive all user keys
  - Key escrow is inherent (PKG can decrypt all messages)
  - Public key is any string identifier (email, name, etc.)
  - Uses bilinear pairings on elliptic curves (expensive)
  - BLS12-381 recommended for modern implementations
  - Eliminates need for certificate infrastructure
  - Useful for forward-secure encryption (time-based keys)
  - Decryption requires pairing computation (slow)
  - Vulnerable to quantum computers
  - Consider using for email encryption to future recipients
  - Can implement time-based access control
  - Hierarchical IBE (HIBE) available for delegation
