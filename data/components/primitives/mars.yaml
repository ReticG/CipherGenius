description: |
  MARS is a symmetric block cipher developed by IBM as an AES finalist. It operates on 128-bit blocks with
  variable key sizes of 128, 192, and 256 bits. MARS features a complex heterogeneous design combining multiple
  cryptographic techniques including type-3 Feistel structure, S-boxes, and data-dependent rotations.

implementation_notes: |
  - Complex design with three layers: forward mixing, cryptographic core, backward mixing
  - Uses 8x32-bit S-boxes generated from SHA-1
  - 32 rounds provide conservative security margin
  - Higher memory requirements due to large S-boxes
  - Not widely adopted despite being an AES finalist, consider AES for broader compatibility
