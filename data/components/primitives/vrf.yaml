description: |
  A Verifiable Random Function (VRF) is a pseudorandom function that provides
  publicly verifiable proofs of its outputs. The key holder can compute the function
  and generate a proof, which anyone can verify using the public key. Used extensively
  in blockchain consensus and leader election protocols.

parameters:
  key_size: [256, 512]
  output_size: 256  # Typically 256 bits
  proof_size: [80, 96]
  curve: [Curve25519, secp256k1, BLS12-381]

properties:
  - pseudorandom

implementation_notes: |
  - VRF output is pseudorandom and unpredictable
  - Public key allows anyone to verify correctness of output
  - Secret key holder can compute output and generate proof
  - Used in Algorand, Cardano, Polkadot, DFINITY, and others
  - ECVRF (Elliptic Curve VRF) most common implementation
  - Based on elliptic curve cryptography (vulnerable to quantum)
  - Proof size typically 80-96 bytes
  - Output deterministic for same input and key
  - Cannot forge valid outputs without secret key
  - Use Curve25519 or secp256k1 for implementations
  - Critical for proof-of-stake blockchain consensus
  - Enables fair leader election without trusted parties
