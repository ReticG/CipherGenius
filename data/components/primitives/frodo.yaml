description: |
  FrodoKEM is a conservative post-quantum KEM based on Learning With Errors (LWE).
  It offers high confidence in security but with larger keys and slower performance than Kyber.

implementation_notes: |
  - NIST PQC alternate candidate (not selected but trusted)
  - Most conservative lattice-based KEM
  - Based on plain LWE (not Ring-LWE or Module-LWE)
  - Very large keys (~9.6 KB for 128-bit security)
  - Slower than Kyber but higher security confidence
  - No algebraic structure exploits possible
  - FrodoKEM-640: 9616-byte public keys
  - IND-CCA2 secure
  - Quantum-resistant
  - Use when maximum security assurance needed
  - Trade performance for conservative security
  - Recommended for ultra-high-value targets
