description: |
  SM2 is a Chinese national cryptographic standard for elliptic curve digital signatures.
  It is similar to ECDSA but with specific parameter choices and is mandatory in Chinese applications.

implementation_notes: |
  - Chinese national cryptographic standard
  - Mandatory for certain Chinese applications
  - Based on 256-bit elliptic curve (SM2P256V1)
  - Uses SM3 hash function (Chinese SHA-256 equivalent)
  - Similar to ECDSA but with different parameters
  - Supports both deterministic and random nonce generation
  - 64-byte signatures (32-byte r, 32-byte s)
  - Required in Chinese commercial cryptography
  - ISO/IEC standardized in 2018
  - Not quantum-resistant
  - Good performance, comparable to ECDSA P-256
  - Use with SM3 and SM4 for complete Chinese crypto suite
