name: BLAKE2b
full_name: BLAKE2b Hash Function
category: hash_function
description: |
  BLAKE2b is a cryptographic hash function faster than MD5, SHA-1, SHA-2, and SHA-3,
  yet is at least as secure as SHA-3. It is optimized for 64-bit platforms.

implementation_notes: |
  - Faster than SHA-256 while providing equal or better security
  - Can be used as MAC without HMAC construction
  - Supports personalization and salting natively
  - Used in Argon2 password hashing algorithm
  - Default choice for many modern applications (Zcash, WireGuard)
  - BLAKE2s variant optimized for 8-32 bit platforms
