full_name: Fortuna Cryptographically Secure Pseudorandom Number Generator
category: random_number_generator
description: |
  Fortuna is a cryptographically secure PRNG designed by Niels Ferguson and Bruce Schneier.
  It addresses various theoretical and practical issues in earlier PRNGs like Yarrow,
  particularly improving entropy accumulation and pool management.

implementation_notes: |
  - Uses 32 entropy pools with exponential reseeding schedule
  - Pool 0 reseeded most frequently, pool 31 least frequently
  - AES-256 in counter mode for generation
  - SHA-256 for entropy accumulation
  - Automatic recovery from state compromise
  - Reseed at most once per 100ms to prevent entropy depletion
  - Each pool must accumulate at least 64 bytes before first reseed
  - Generator reseeds from pools in round-robin fashion
  - Used in FreeBSD, macOS, and various crypto libraries
  - Superior to Yarrow in entropy management
  - Requires multiple entropy sources for best operation
