full_name: Rainbow Signature Scheme
category: signature
description: |
  Rainbow is a multivariate signature scheme that was a NIST PQC finalist.
  It was broken in 2022 by a practical key recovery attack, making it of historical interest only.

implementation_notes: |
  - BROKEN in 2022 - DO NOT USE
  - Was a NIST PQC Round 3 finalist
  - Ward Beullens published practical key recovery attack
  - Attack complexity: ~2^53 operations for Rainbow-I
  - Can break on a laptop in a weekend
  - Very large public keys (hundreds of KB)
  - Fast signing and verification (when it was considered secure)
  - Small signatures (66 bytes for Rainbow-I)
  - Of historical interest only
  - Shows importance of conservative security margins
  - Example of post-quantum scheme that failed
