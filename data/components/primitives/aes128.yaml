implementation_notes: |
  - Preferred for IoT and mobile devices due to lower computational requirements
  - Use with authenticated encryption modes (GCM, CCM) for data integrity
  - Hardware acceleration available on most modern processors (AES-NI)
  - AES-128 provides adequate security for most commercial applications
  - For long-term security (>20 years), consider AES-256
