description: |
  ChaCha20 is a stream cipher designed by Daniel J. Bernstein. It is optimized for software
  implementations and provides excellent performance on a wide range of platforms, including
  resource-constrained devices.

implementation_notes: |
  - No lookup tables required - resistant to cache-timing attacks
  - Excellent performance on ARM processors
  - Constant-time by design
  - ChaCha20-Poly1305 is the recommended AEAD construction
  - Used in TLS 1.3, WireGuard VPN, and other modern protocols
  - Nonce must never be reused with the same key
