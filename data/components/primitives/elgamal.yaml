description: |
  ElGamal is an early public-key signature scheme based on the discrete logarithm problem.
  It is of historical importance but largely superseded by DSA and ECDSA in modern applications.

implementation_notes: |
  - Legacy algorithm, largely superseded by DSA/ECDSA
  - Signatures are twice the size of the modulus
  - Requires random nonce per signature (critical for security)
  - Nonce reuse reveals private key
  - Used in some early PGP implementations
  - Basis for DSA and ECDSA designs
  - Slower than RSA and DSA
  - Large signature sizes (4096 bits for 2048-bit keys)
  - Vulnerable to quantum computers
  - DSA was specifically designed to improve ElGamal
  - Of historical and academic interest
  - Not recommended for new deployments
