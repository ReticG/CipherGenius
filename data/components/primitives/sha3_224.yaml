implementation_notes: |
  - Based on Keccak sponge construction
  - Different internal structure from SHA-2 family
  - Good for hedging against SHA-2 vulnerabilities
  - Slightly slower than SHA-224 in software
  - No length extension attacks (unlike SHA-2)
  - Larger rate (1152 bits) than SHA3-256
  - Provides 112-bit collision resistance
