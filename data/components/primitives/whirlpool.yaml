description: |
  Whirlpool is a cryptographic hash function producing a 512-bit digest.
  Designed by Vincent Rijmen and Paulo Barreto, based on a modified AES design.

implementation_notes: |
  - Based on modified AES structure (W-transformation)
  - Designed by co-creator of AES (Rijmen)
  - ISO/IEC standardized since 2000
  - Three versions: Whirlpool-0, Whirlpool-T, Whirlpool (final)
  - Use latest version (Whirlpool, 2003)
  - Slower than SHA-2 and SHA-3
  - Good security margin, no practical attacks
  - Less common than SHA-2/SHA-3
  - Consider SHA-512 or SHA3-512 for better performance
  - Useful for diversity in hash function selection
