implementation_notes: |
  - NIST PQC Round 4 finalist (selected for standardization)
  - Longest security track record (1978, 45+ years)
  - Highest confidence in post-quantum security
  - Very large public keys (261 KB to 1.3 MB)
  - Small ciphertexts (128-256 bytes)
  - Zero decapsulation failure probability
  - Fast encapsulation and decapsulation
  - Excellent hardware performance
  - Based on binary Goppa codes
  - Conservative and well-understood
  - Quantum-resistant
  - Use when maximum security assurance needed
  - Public key size is main drawback
  - Best for store-and-forward scenarios
