implementation_notes: |
  - NIST PQC winner (standardized as ML-KEM-256)
  - Highest security level of Kyber variants
  - 1568-byte public keys and ciphertexts
  - Equivalent to AES-256 security level
  - Based on Module Learning With Errors (M-LWE)
  - IND-CCA2 secure KEM
  - Good performance despite highest security
  - Suitable for hybrid schemes (e.g., X448 + Kyber-1024)
  - Quantum-resistant
  - Recommended for top-secret/classified use
  - Use for long-term security (30+ years)
  - Larger keys than Kyber-768 (1.5 KB vs 1.2 KB)
  - Consider Kyber-768 unless maximum security needed
