implementation_notes: |
  - NIST standardized as SLH-DSA (FIPS 205)
  - Very large signatures (7-30 KB)
  - Based only on hash functions (conservative security)
  - Slower than Dilithium
  - No structured hardness assumptions (unlike lattice-based)
  - Good for ultra-long-term security
  - Stateless (no state management needed)
