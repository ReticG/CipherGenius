name: MD5
full_name: Message Digest Algorithm 5
category: hash_function
description: |
  MD5 is a widely used but cryptographically broken hash function. It should NOT
  be used for security purposes but is still used for non-cryptographic checksums.

implementation_notes: |
  - SEVERELY BROKEN: Do not use for ANY security purpose
  - Practical collision attacks since 2004
  - Can generate collisions in seconds on modern hardware
  - Only acceptable for non-adversarial checksums
  - Included only for educational purposes and legacy support
  - Use SHA-256, SHA-3, or BLAKE3 instead
