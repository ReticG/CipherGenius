implementation_notes: |
  - Based on Keccak sponge construction
  - Different internal structure from SHA-2 family
  - Good for hedging against SHA-2 vulnerabilities
  - Slowest SHA-3 variant due to smallest rate (576 bits)
  - No length extension attacks (unlike SHA-2)
  - Provides 256-bit collision resistance
  - Highest security margin in SHA-3 family
  - Often paired with 521-bit ECC curves
  - Consider SHA3-256 if performance is more important than security margin
