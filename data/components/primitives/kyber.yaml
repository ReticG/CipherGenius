implementation_notes: |
  - NIST standardized as ML-KEM (FIPS 203)
  - Three security levels: Kyber512, Kyber768, Kyber1024
  - Resistant to quantum computer attacks
  - Fast key generation and encapsulation
  - Recommended for hybrid mode with X25519
  - Larger keys than classical algorithms
  - Critical for post-quantum transition
