description: |
  Pedersen commitment is a cryptographic commitment scheme based on the discrete
  logarithm problem. It provides both hiding and binding properties while being
  homomorphic, making it useful in zero-knowledge proofs and blockchain applications.

implementation_notes: |
  - Commitment: C = g^m * h^r where m is message, r is random blinding factor
  - Requires trusted setup or verifiable generation of generators g and h
  - Homomorphic: C1 + C2 = commitment to (m1 + m2)
  - Used extensively in Monero, Zcash, and Grin
  - Bulletproofs rely heavily on Pedersen commitments
  - Cannot provide perfect hiding (only computational)
  - Binding property relies on discrete log hardness
  - Popular in confidential transactions for hiding amounts
  - Use strong elliptic curves (secp256k1, Curve25519)
  - Vulnerable to quantum computers (Shor's algorithm)
