implementation_notes: |
  - NIST standardized as ML-DSA (FIPS 204)
  - Three security levels: Dilithium2, Dilithium3, Dilithium5
  - Resistant to quantum computer attacks
  - Larger signatures than ECDSA/EdDSA
  - Fast signing and verification
  - Recommended for post-quantum migration
  - Can be used in hybrid mode with Ed25519
