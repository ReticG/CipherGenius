name: SM4
full_name: ShangMi 4 Block Cipher
category: block_cipher
description: |
  SM4 is a symmetric block cipher standardized by the Chinese government for use in commercial applications.
  It operates on 128-bit blocks using 128-bit keys with a Feistel-like structure and 32 rounds. SM4 is
  mandatory for certain Chinese cryptographic applications and is increasingly used in international standards.

implementation_notes: |
  - Uses four 8x8-bit S-boxes based on affine transformation
  - Key expansion generates 32 round keys from the master key
  - Gaining international recognition and ISO standardization
  - Hardware implementations benefit from parallel S-box lookups
  - Consider for applications requiring Chinese cryptographic compliance
