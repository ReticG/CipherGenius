description: |
  DES is a symmetric-key block cipher that was widely used from the 1970s through the 1990s.
  It operates on 64-bit blocks with a 56-bit key (64 bits with parity). Now considered insecure
  due to small key size.

implementation_notes: |
  - DO NOT use for new applications
  - Key size too small for modern security requirements
  - Vulnerable to brute-force attacks
  - Use 3DES or AES instead
