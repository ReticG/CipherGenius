name: SHA-512
full_name: Secure Hash Algorithm 512-bit
category: hash_function
description: |
  SHA-512 is a cryptographic hash function from the SHA-2 family, producing a 512-bit (64-byte)
  hash value. It offers higher security margin than SHA-256 and is optimized for 64-bit processors.

parameters:
  output_size: 512
  block_size: 1024

properties:
  - collision_resistant
  - preimage_resistant
  - second_preimage_resistant
  - deterministic
  - avalanche_effect
  - 64bit_optimized

performance:
  software_speed: high
  hardware_speed: very_high
  memory: low
  power: medium

security:
  security_level: 256  # 512-bit preimage resistance, 256-bit collision resistance
  best_attack: none_practical
  attack_complexity: "2^256 for collision, 2^512 for preimage"

implementation_notes: |
  - Faster than SHA-256 on 64-bit processors
  - Larger output provides higher security margin
  - Use for high-security applications requiring 256-bit security
  - For password hashing, use PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA512 or Argon2
  - Truncated variants: SHA-512/256, SHA-512/224
  - More secure than SHA-256 for long-term security
  - Widely supported in modern cryptographic libraries
