full_name: Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption
category: public_key_encryption
description: |
  CP-ABE is an advanced form of public-key encryption where ciphertexts are encrypted
  under an access policy over attributes, and private keys are associated with sets
  of attributes. Decryption succeeds only if the key's attributes satisfy the
  ciphertext's policy. Enables fine-grained access control.

implementation_notes: |
  - Requires trusted Attribute Authority (AA) for key generation
  - Access policy embedded in ciphertext (e.g., "Doctor OR Nurse")
  - Private keys associated with attribute sets
  - Decryption computational cost linear in policy complexity
  - Very expensive pairing operations required
  - BLS12-381 recommended for security and performance
  - Supports AND, OR, threshold gates in policies
  - Collusion resistant (users cannot combine keys)
  - Ciphertext size grows with policy complexity
  - Consider using for cloud storage with complex access policies
  - Multiple authority schemes available for distributed trust
  - Much slower than traditional public-key encryption
  - Not suitable for high-frequency operations
