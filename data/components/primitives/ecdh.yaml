description: |
  ECDH is a key agreement protocol based on elliptic curves. It allows two parties
  to establish a shared secret over an insecure channel.

implementation_notes: |
  - Provides forward secrecy in TLS and other protocols
  - Ephemeral ECDH (ECDHE) recommended for forward secrecy
  - Must validate public keys to prevent attacks
  - Combine with KDF (like HKDF) to derive session keys
  - X25519 often preferred over NIST curves
