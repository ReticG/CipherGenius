  TFHE (Fast Fully Homomorphic Encryption over the Torus) is a fully homomorphic
  encryption scheme that enables arbitrary computations on encrypted data without
  decryption. TFHE is known for fast bootstrapping and supports gate-by-gate
  evaluation with minimal noise growth.

implementation_notes: |
  - Based on Learning With Errors (LWE) problem over torus
  - Supports arbitrary boolean circuits on encrypted data
  - Fast bootstrapping (~13ms per gate on modern hardware)
  - Bootstrapping refreshes ciphertext, removing noise
  - Ciphertext size expansion factor very large (1000x+)
  - Gate-by-gate evaluation (AND, OR, XOR, NOT)
  - Quantum resistant (lattice-based)
  - Memory requirements very high (GB range)
  - Used in private machine learning and encrypted inference
  - Concrete library provides TFHE implementation
  - Not suitable for large-scale computations (yet)
  - Consider BFV/CKKS for SIMD operations
  - TFHE best for boolean circuits and decision trees
  - Ongoing research to improve performance
