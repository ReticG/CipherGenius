full_name: BLAKE3 Cryptographic Hash Function
category: hash_function
description: |
  BLAKE3 is a cryptographic hash function based on BLAKE2. It is extremely fast
  while maintaining high security, and supports parallel hashing and tree hashing.

parameters:
  output_size: 256
  block_size: 1024

properties:
  - collision_resistant
  - preimage_resistant
  - second_preimage_resistant
  - parallelizable
  - tree_hashing
  - incremental_updates

performance:
  software_speed: very_high
  hardware_speed: very_high
  memory: very_low
  power: very_low

security:
  security_level: 256
  best_attack: none_practical
  attack_complexity: "2^256 for collision resistance"
  status: secure
  standardized: false
  proven_security: true

implementation_notes: |
  - Extremely fast: faster than SHA-256, SHA-3, BLAKE2
  - Parallelizable across cores
  - Tree hashing mode for parallel processing
  - Supports incremental updates
  - Arbitrary output length
  - No initialization vector needed
  - Used by Zcash, Filecoin, and others
