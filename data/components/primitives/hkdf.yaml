name: HKDF
full_name: HMAC-based Key Derivation Function
category: construction
description: |
  HKDF is a key derivation function based on HMAC. It is designed to derive
  cryptographic keys from a shared secret or high-entropy input.

parameters:
  output_size: 256

properties:
  - key_derivation
  - extract_then_expand
  - cryptographically_strong
  - deterministic
  - context_binding

performance:
  software_speed: very_high
  hardware_speed: high
  memory: low
  power: low

security:
  security_level: 256  # HKDF-SHA256 provides up to 256-bit security
  best_attack: none_practical
  attack_complexity: "depends on underlying hash (SHA-256: 2^256)"
  status: secure
  standardized: true
  proven_security: true

compatible_with:
  - HMAC
  - SHA-256
  - SHA-512

use_cases:
  - tls_1_3_key_schedule
  - signal_protocol
  - wireguard

implementation_notes: |
  - Two-step process: Extract then Expand
  - Extract: HKDF-Extract(salt, IKM) = HMAC-Hash(salt, IKM)
  - Expand: HKDF-Expand(PRK, info, L) generates output keys
  - Salt is optional but recommended for security
  - Info provides application-specific context
  - Used in TLS 1.3 for all key derivation
  - Not designed for password hashing (use PBKDF2/Argon2)
  - Can generate multiple independent keys
