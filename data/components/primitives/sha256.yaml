name: SHA-256
full_name: Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit
category: hash_function
description: |
  SHA-256 is a cryptographic hash function from the SHA-2 family, standardized by NIST.
  It produces a 256-bit (32-byte) hash value and is widely used in various security applications.

implementation_notes: |
  - Use hardware acceleration (SHA extensions) when available
  - Consider SHA-256 for general purpose hashing
  - For password hashing, use PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 or Argon2
  - Bitcoin uses double SHA-256 (SHA-256(SHA-256(data)))
  - More secure than SHA-1, recommended for new applications
