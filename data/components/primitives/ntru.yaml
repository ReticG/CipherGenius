implementation_notes: |
  - NIST PQC Round 3 finalist (not selected, but trusted)
  - One of the oldest lattice-based schemes (1996)
  - Excellent performance, faster than Kyber in some cases
  - 699-byte public keys for 128-bit security
  - Very fast key generation and encapsulation
  - Small non-zero decapsulation failure probability
  - Two variants: HPS (faster) and HRSS (more robust)
  - ntruhps2048509: 128-bit security, fastest
  - ntruhrss701: more conservative parameters
  - Quantum-resistant
  - Suitable for IoT and embedded systems
  - 25+ years of cryptanalysis without major breaks
  - Good alternative to Kyber
