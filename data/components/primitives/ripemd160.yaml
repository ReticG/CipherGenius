description: |
  RIPEMD-160 is a cryptographic hash function developed in Europe as an alternative
  to SHA-1. It produces a 160-bit hash value and is used in Bitcoin addresses.

implementation_notes: |
  - Used in Bitcoin address generation (SHA-256 then RIPEMD-160)
  - Dual-stream parallel design
  - Slightly slower than SHA-1
  - 160-bit output considered marginal for long-term security
  - For new applications, prefer SHA-256 or SHA-3
