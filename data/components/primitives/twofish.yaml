description: |
  Twofish is a symmetric block cipher and one of the AES finalists. It operates on 128-bit blocks
  with key sizes up to 256 bits. Known for excellent security margin and flexibility.

implementation_notes: |
  - Strong security margin, no significant attacks
  - Slower than AES on modern hardware (lacks hardware acceleration)
  - Good choice when hardware AES unavailable
  - Key setup is relatively expensive
