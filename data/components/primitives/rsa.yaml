description: |
  RSA is one of the first public-key cryptosystems and is widely used for secure data transmission.
  It is based on the practical difficulty of factoring the product of two large prime numbers.

implementation_notes: |
  - Never use textbook RSA (always use proper padding)
  - OAEP is recommended for encryption
  - PSS is recommended for signatures
  - Minimum 2048-bit keys for new applications
  - 3072-bit for high security, 4096-bit for long-term
  - Vulnerable to quantum computers (Shor's algorithm)
  - Use constant-time implementations
  - Consider ECC alternatives for better performance
