implementation_notes: |
  - SHAKE256 variant of SPHINCS+ (part of FIPS 205)
  - Very large signatures (7-30 KB depending on security level)
  - Based only on hash functions (no structured assumptions)
  - Slower than Dilithium but more conservative
  - SHAKE256 provides quantum-resistant hash security
  - Good for scenarios requiring maximum security assurance
  - Stateless operation (no state management complexity)
  - Three security levels: 128-bit, 192-bit, 256-bit
  - Can be used when lattice-based schemes are distrusted
