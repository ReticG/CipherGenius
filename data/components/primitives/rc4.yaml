category: stream_cipher
description: |
  RC4 is a stream cipher designed by Ron Rivest in 1987. Once widely used in protocols like WEP
  and TLS, it is now considered insecure and should not be used in new systems.

implementation_notes: |
  - DEPRECATED - DO NOT USE
  - Known biases in keystream output
  - Vulnerable to multiple practical attacks
  - Removed from TLS 1.3
  - Use ChaCha20 or AES-CTR instead
