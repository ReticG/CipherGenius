description: |
  Salsa20 is a stream cipher designed by Daniel J. Bernstein. It is the predecessor
  to ChaCha20 and was a finalist in the eSTREAM competition.

parameters:
  key_size: [128, 256]
  nonce_size: 64
  rounds: 20
  block_size: 512

properties:
  - software_optimized
  - constant_time
  - no_lookup_tables
  - cache_timing_resistant

performance:

implementation_notes: |
  - eSTREAM portfolio cipher
  - Predecessor to ChaCha20
  - Excellent software performance
  - 64-bit nonce (smaller than ChaCha20's 96-bit)
  - Constant-time by design
