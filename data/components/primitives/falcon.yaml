implementation_notes: |
  - NIST PQC finalist (not selected but recommended)
  - Smallest signatures among lattice-based schemes
  - Fast verification, moderate signing speed
  - Uses floating-point arithmetic (implementation complexity)
  - FALCON-512: 666-byte signatures, 128-bit security
  - FALCON-1024: 1280-byte signatures, 256-bit security
  - Based on NTRU lattices
  - Requires careful floating-point implementation
  - Quantum-resistant
  - Suitable for constrained environments
