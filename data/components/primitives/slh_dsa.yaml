implementation_notes: |
  - Official NIST FIPS 205 standard (standardized SPHINCS+)
  - FIPS-approved for federal government use
  - Very large signatures (7-30 KB depending on security level)
  - Based only on hash functions (no algebraic structure)
  - Most conservative post-quantum signature option
  - Slower than ML-DSA (Dilithium) but more conservative
  - No structured hardness assumptions required
  - Stateless operation (no state synchronization needed)
  - Two hash function options: SHAKE256 or SHA-256
  - Three security levels: SLH-DSA-128, SLH-DSA-192, SLH-DSA-256
  - Use when maximum security assurance is required
  - Recommended alternative to ML-DSA for diversification
  - Good for long-term archives and critical infrastructure
