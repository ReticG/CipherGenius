implementation_notes: |
  - Extremely fast ECDH operations
  - Constant-time by design
  - Safe curve (rigidly designed parameters)
  - Used in X25519, Signal Protocol, WireGuard
  - Preferred over NIST curves by many cryptographers
  - Not FIPS approved (use P-256 if needed)
  - 32-byte keys and public keys
