full_name: Kyber-768 Key Encapsulation Mechanism
category: key_exchange
description: |
  Kyber-768 is the 192-bit security level variant of the NIST PQC winner Kyber.
  It offers higher security than Kyber-512 with still excellent performance and is the recommended default.

implementation_notes: |
  - NIST PQC winner (standardized as ML-KEM-192)
  - RECOMMENDED DEFAULT for most applications
  - 1184-byte public keys, 1088-byte ciphertexts
  - Equivalent to AES-192 security level
  - Based on Module Learning With Errors (M-LWE)
  - IND-CCA2 secure KEM
  - Excellent performance with higher security margin
  - Suitable for hybrid schemes (e.g., X25519 + Kyber-768)
  - Used by Google, Cloudflare, AWS
  - Quantum-resistant
  - Best balance of security and performance
  - Recommended by NIST for general use
  - Use for most production applications
