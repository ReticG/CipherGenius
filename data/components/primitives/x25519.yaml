implementation_notes: |
  - Use with HKDF for key derivation after ECDH
  - Typical usage: X25519 + HKDF + ChaCha20-Poly1305
  - Generate ephemeral key pairs for each session
  - Never reuse private keys across sessions
  - Constant-time implementation prevents side-channel attacks
  - Simple API with no special point handling required
  - Widely adopted in modern protocols (TLS 1.3, Signal, WireGuard)
  - Faster than NIST P-256
