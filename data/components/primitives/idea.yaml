category: block_cipher
description: |
  IDEA is a symmetric block cipher designed by James Massey and Xuejia Lai in 1991. It operates on 64-bit blocks
  using 128-bit keys and was widely used in PGP encryption. Originally patented, the algorithm is now free to use
  as the patents have expired, though it's considered legacy due to its small block size.

implementation_notes: |
  - Uses three group operations: XOR, addition mod 2^16, and multiplication mod 2^16+1
  - Key schedule generates 52 16-bit subkeys from the 128-bit master key
  - Patents expired in 2012, making it freely usable without licensing
  - 64-bit block size vulnerable to birthday attacks after 2^32 blocks
  - For new applications, use AES instead of IDEA for better security margins
