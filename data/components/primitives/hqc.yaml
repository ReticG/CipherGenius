implementation_notes: |
  - NIST Round 4 candidate (under evaluation)
  - Code-based cryptography (alternative to lattices)
  - Based on Hamming metric over quasi-cyclic codes
  - Uses Reed-Solomon error correction
  - Simple and conservative design
  - Larger public keys (~2-7 KB depending on level)
  - No decryption failures (unlike BIKE)
  - Good for diversification from lattice schemes
  - Three security levels: 128-bit, 192-bit, 256-bit
  - Deterministic decapsulation (more predictable)
  - Not yet standardized (experimental use only)
  - Consider for scenarios requiring code-based security
