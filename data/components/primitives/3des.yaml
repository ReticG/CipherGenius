name: 3DES
full_name: Triple Data Encryption Standard
category: block_cipher
description: |
  3DES applies the DES cipher three times to each data block. It uses either two or three
  independent keys (112-bit or 168-bit effective security). Being phased out in favor of AES.

  - NIST deprecated 3DES in 2023
  - Use AES-128 or higher for new applications
  - 64-bit block size limits data that can be encrypted
