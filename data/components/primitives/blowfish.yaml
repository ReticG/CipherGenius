description: |
  Blowfish is a symmetric block cipher designed by Bruce Schneier in 1993. It operates on 64-bit blocks
  and supports variable key sizes from 32 to 448 bits. Known for its speed and effectiveness, it's now
  considered legacy due to its small block size, which makes it vulnerable to birthday attacks.

implementation_notes: |
  - Pre-compute P-array and S-boxes during key setup for better performance
  - Key setup is intentionally slow to resist brute-force attacks
  - Not recommended for new applications due to 64-bit block size vulnerability
  - Consider using a more modern cipher like AES for new implementations
  - Bcrypt (based on Blowfish) remains secure for password hashing
