full_name: Poly1305 Message Authentication Code
category: mac
description: |
  Poly1305 is a cryptographic message authentication code (MAC) created by Daniel J. Bernstein.
  It can be used to verify the integrity and authenticity of a message. It uses a one-time key
  derived from the encryption key.

implementation_notes: |
  - Extremely fast - typically 2-3 CPU cycles per byte
  - Requires one-time key derived from main key
  - Must use fresh key for each message (typically derived from nonce)
  - Constant-time implementation critical for security
  - Often paired with ChaCha20 for AEAD construction
