description: |
  Yarrow is a cryptographically secure PRNG designed by Bruce Schneier, John Kelsey,
  and Niels Ferguson. It was a predecessor to Fortuna and focuses on entropy
  accumulation from multiple sources with periodic reseeding.

parameters:
  block_cipher: [3DES, AES]
  hash_function: SHA-1
  pool_count: 2
  fast_pool_threshold: 100
  slow_pool_threshold: 2

properties:
  - cryptographically_secure
  - automatic_reseeding
  - entropy_accumulation
  - dual_pool_design
  - multiple_entropy_sources

implementation_notes: |
  - Uses two entropy pools: fast and slow
  - Fast pool reseeds frequently (after 100 events)
  - Slow pool reseeds infrequently (after 2 fast reseeds)
  - Originally designed with 3DES and SHA-1
  - Superseded by Fortuna which addresses several weaknesses
  - Used in older versions of macOS and FreeBSD
  - Modern implementations should use Fortuna instead
  - Historical significance in CSPRNG design
  - Dual pool design influenced later PRNGs
  - Consider this legacy; prefer Fortuna or NIST DRBGs
