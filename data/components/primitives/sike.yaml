description: |
  SIKE was a NIST PQC Round 4 candidate based on supersingular isogeny Diffie-Hellman.
  It was broken in 2022 by an efficient classical attack, making it of historical interest only.

implementation_notes: |
  - BROKEN in 2022 - DO NOT USE
  - Was a NIST PQC Round 4 candidate
  - Castryck-Decru attack breaks it in polynomial time
  - Attack is practical and efficient on classical computers
  - Had smallest key sizes among PQC candidates (330 bytes)
  - Very slow operations (hundreds of milliseconds)
  - Based on supersingular elliptic curve isogenies
  - The attack broke SIDH, the underlying primitive
  - Shows importance of conservative cryptographic design
  - Of historical and academic interest only
  - Example of PQC candidate that failed
  - NOT quantum-resistant despite being post-quantum candidate
  - Entire isogeny-based approach needs reevaluation
