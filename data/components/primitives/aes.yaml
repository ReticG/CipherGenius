  AES is a symmetric block cipher standardized by NIST. It operates on 128-bit blocks
  and supports key sizes of 128, 192, and 256 bits.

parameters:
  block_size: 128
  key_size: [128, 192, 256]
  rounds: 10

implementation_notes: |
  - Use AES-NI instructions when available for best performance
  - Avoid lookup tables in security-critical contexts to prevent cache timing attacks
  - Use constant-time implementations for side-channel resistance
  - AES-256 recommended for long-term security
