implementation_notes: |
  - Two-step process: Extract then Expand
  - Extract: HKDF-Extract(salt, IKM) = HMAC-SHA512(salt, IKM)
  - Expand: HKDF-Expand(PRK, info, L) generates output keys
  - Salt is optional but recommended for security
  - Info provides application-specific context
  - Not designed for password hashing (use PBKDF2/Argon2)
  - Can generate up to 16,320 bytes (64 * 255) of output
  - Provides higher security margin than SHA-256 variant
  - Recommended for applications requiring 256-bit security
