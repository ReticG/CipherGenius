category: hash_function
description: |
  SHA-384 is a truncated version of SHA-512, producing a 384-bit hash value.
  It offers a good balance between security and output size.

implementation_notes: |
  - Truncated version of SHA-512
  - Same performance as SHA-512 on 64-bit platforms
  - Approved for US government TOP SECRET information
  - Good for applications needing >256-bit but <512-bit output
  - Often used in combination with ECDSA-384
