name: SHA3-256
full_name: SHA-3 with 256-bit output
category: hash_function
description: |
  SHA3-256 is part of the SHA-3 family based on the Keccak algorithm.
  It provides 256-bit hash output and is fundamentally different from SHA-2.

implementation_notes: |
  - Based on Keccak sponge construction
  - Different internal structure from SHA-2
  - Good for hedging against SHA-2 vulnerabilities
  - Slightly slower than SHA-256 in software
  - No length extension attacks
  - SHAKE128/SHAKE256 are XOF variants
