implementation_notes: |
  - Based on Keccak sponge construction
  - Different internal structure from SHA-2 family
  - Good for hedging against SHA-2 vulnerabilities
  - Slower than SHA3-256 due to smaller rate
  - No length extension attacks (unlike SHA-2)
  - Provides 192-bit collision resistance
  - Suitable for applications requiring higher security margins
  - Often paired with 384-bit ECC curves
