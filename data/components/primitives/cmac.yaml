description: |
  CMAC is a block cipher-based MAC algorithm. It can be used with any approved
  block cipher such as AES to provide message authentication.

implementation_notes: |
  - Based on CBC-MAC with improvements
  - No length extension attacks
  - Requires only one key
  - AES-CMAC widely used
  - Used in various protocols including 802.11i
  - More efficient than HMAC in hardware with AES acceleration
