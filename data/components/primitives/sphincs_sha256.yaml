implementation_notes: |
  - SHA-256 variant of SPHINCS+ (part of FIPS 205)
  - Very large signatures (7-30 KB depending on security level)
  - Based only on SHA-256 hash function
  - May have better hardware acceleration than SHAKE variant
  - Familiar SHA-2 family provides confidence
  - Slower than Dilithium but more conservative
  - Good for scenarios requiring proven hash functions
  - Stateless operation (no state management)
  - Three security levels: 128-bit, 192-bit, 256-bit
  - Suitable for environments with SHA-256 hardware support
