description: |
  RC6 is a symmetric block cipher designed by Ron Rivest and others as an AES finalist. It operates on 128-bit blocks
  and supports variable key sizes of 128, 192, and 256 bits. Based on RC5 with additional features, RC6 uses
  data-dependent rotations and is notable for its simplicity and efficiency in both software and hardware.

implementation_notes: |
  - Uses integer multiplication for increased diffusion compared to RC5
  - Four working registers provide parallelism opportunities
  - Data-dependent rotations provide non-linearity and security
  - Despite being an AES finalist, RC6 is not as widely adopted as AES
  - Patent status should be verified before commercial use
