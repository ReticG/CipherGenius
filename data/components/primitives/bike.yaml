implementation_notes: |
  - NIST Round 4 candidate (under evaluation)
  - Code-based cryptography (different from lattices)
  - Based on QC-MDPC (Quasi-Cyclic Moderate Density Parity Check)
  - Compact public keys (~1.5 KB for 128-bit security)
  - Uses bit-flipping decoding algorithm
  - Small decryption failure probability (needs careful implementation)
  - Good alternative to lattice-based schemes
  - Provides cryptographic diversity
  - Hardware-friendly design
  - Not yet standardized (use with caution in production)
  - Three security levels: L1 (128-bit), L3 (192-bit), L5 (256-bit)
