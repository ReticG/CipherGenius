description: |
  SHA-1 is a cryptographic hash function designed by the NSA. It is now considered
  broken for cryptographic purposes but still used in some legacy systems.

  - DEPRECATED: Do not use for new applications
  - Practical collision attacks demonstrated in 2017
  - NIST deprecated SHA-1 for digital signatures in 2011
  - Still used in Git for non-cryptographic purposes
  - Migration to SHA-256 or SHA-3 strongly recommended
  - Only included for educational and legacy compatibility
