description: |
  CAST-128 (commonly known as CAST5) is a symmetric block cipher designed by Carlisle Adams and Stafford Tavares.
  It operates on 64-bit blocks with key sizes from 40 to 128 bits. CAST5 is widely used in PGP and GPG
  encryption systems and was selected as a finalist in the AES competition.

implementation_notes: |
  - Widely supported in OpenPGP implementations for backward compatibility
  - S-boxes are generated from bent functions for cryptographic strength
  - Key schedule is computationally efficient compared to other ciphers
  - 64-bit block size makes it vulnerable to birthday attacks on large datasets
  - For new PGP/GPG implementations, consider using AES instead
