implementation_notes: |
  - NIST PQC alternate candidate (not selected for standardization)
  - Based on zero-knowledge proofs of knowledge
  - Uses LowMC block cipher as underlying primitive
  - Very large signatures (10-50 KB depending on parameters)
  - Slow signing and verification
  - Unique approach using only symmetric primitives
  - Provable security in random oracle model
  - Picnic3 is the optimized version
  - Quantum-resistant
  - Not recommended for production due to performance
  - Interesting theoretical construction
