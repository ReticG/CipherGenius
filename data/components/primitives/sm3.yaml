implementation_notes: |
  - Official Chinese National Standard (GM/T 0004-2012)
  - Added to ISO/IEC 10118-3:2018
  - Similar structure to SHA-256 but with differences
  - Required for many Chinese government and financial applications
  - Well-analyzed by cryptographic community
  - No practical attacks known
  - Performance comparable to SHA-256
  - Mandatory in Chinese Commercial Cryptography standards
  - Consider for China-specific compliance requirements
  - For international applications, SHA-256 more widely supported
