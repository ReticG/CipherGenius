full_name: Cipher Feedback
category: mode
description: |
  CFB turns a block cipher into a self-synchronizing stream cipher.
  It allows encryption of data smaller than the block size without padding.

parameters:
  block_size: 128
  iv_size: 128
  segment_size: variable

properties:
  - stream_cipher_mode
  - self_synchronizing
  - sequential_encryption
  - no_padding_required
  - error_propagation

performance:
  software_speed: medium
  hardware_speed: medium
  memory: very_low
  power: low

security:
  security_level: 256  # Security depends on underlying cipher (AES-256)
  best_attack: bit_flipping
  attack_complexity: "IV manipulation, bit-flipping attacks"
  status: legacy
  standardized: true
  proven_security: false

implementation_notes: |
  - IV must be unpredictable (random)
  - Self-synchronizing after one block
  - Encryption is sequential (not parallelizable)
  - Decryption is also sequential
  - No padding required
  - Error in ciphertext affects corresponding plaintext bit and next block
  - MUST use with authentication (HMAC)
  - Segment size can vary (1-bit to full block)
  - CFB-8 and CFB-128 are common variants
  - Consider using CTR or AEAD modes for new systems
  - Deprecated for most modern applications
