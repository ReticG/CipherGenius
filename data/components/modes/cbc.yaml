name: CBC
full_name: Cipher Block Chaining
category: mode
description: |
  CBC mode chains each plaintext block with the previous ciphertext block before encryption.
  It is widely used but does not provide authentication and is vulnerable to padding oracle attacks.

parameters:
  block_size: 128
  iv_size: 128
  padding_required: true

properties:
  - encryption_only
  - sequential_encryption
  - parallel_decryption

implementation_notes: |
  - IV must be unpredictable (random)
  - Padding oracle attacks are a serious concern (POODLE, Lucky13)
  - Requires padding (PKCS#7 is common)
  - Encryption is sequential (not parallelizable)
  - Decryption is parallelizable
  - MUST use with MAC (Encrypt-then-MAC preferred)
  - Deprecated in TLS 1.3
  - IV must never be reused with same key
  - Consider using AEAD modes (GCM, ChaCha20-Poly1305) instead
  - For legacy compatibility only
