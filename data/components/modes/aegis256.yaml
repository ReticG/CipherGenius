implementation_notes: |
  - CAESAR competition winner (high-performance portfolio)
  - 256-bit security level (higher than AEGIS-128)
  - Uses AES round function as building block
  - Extremely fast with AES-NI
  - Single-pass authenticated encryption
  - Nonce size is 256 bits (32 bytes)
  - State-based design with 6 AES states
  - Nonce must never be reused
  - Slightly slower than AEGIS-128 but still very fast
  - Better long-term security margin
  - Suitable for post-quantum security considerations
