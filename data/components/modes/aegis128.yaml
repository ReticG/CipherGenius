implementation_notes: |
  - CAESAR competition winner (high-performance portfolio)
  - Uses AES round function as building block (not full AES)
  - Extremely fast with AES-NI (>100 Gbps on modern CPUs)
  - Single-pass authenticated encryption
  - 128-bit security level
  - Nonce must never be reused
  - State-based design with 5 AES states
  - Parallelizable to some degree
  - Standardized in RFC (draft)
  - Faster than AES-GCM on hardware-accelerated platforms
