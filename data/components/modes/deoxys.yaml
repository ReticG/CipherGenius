implementation_notes: |
  - CAESAR competition finalist (3rd portfolio)
  - Uses tweakable AES-based block cipher
  - Single-pass authenticated encryption
  - Efficient in both software and hardware
  - Nonce must never be reused
  - Tweak provides additional input for domain separation
  - Related to AES (uses AES round function)
  - Deoxys-I (BC mode) and Deoxys-II (AEAD mode)
  - Not yet widely standardized
  - Good balance between security and performance
