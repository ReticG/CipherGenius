name: CCM
full_name: Counter with CBC-MAC
category: mode
description: |
  CCM combines Counter mode for encryption with CBC-MAC for authentication.
  It is designed for constrained environments and is simpler than GCM.

parameters:
  block_size: 128
  nonce_size: 13
  tag_size: 128

properties:
  - authenticated_encryption
  - two_pass_mode
  - simple_design
  - patent_free
  - provably_secure

performance:
  software_speed: medium
  hardware_speed: high

  power: very_low

security:
  security_level: 256  # Security depends on underlying cipher (AES-256)
  best_attack: none_practical
  attack_complexity: "2^128 for AES-128, 2^256 for AES-256"
  status: secure
  standardized: true

implementation_notes: |
  - Requires two passes over data (authentication then encryption)
  - Nonce must never be reused
  - Simpler than GCM, good for resource-constrained devices
  - Message length must be known in advance
  - No parallelization possible
  - Lower memory footprint than GCM
  - Widely used in IoT and wireless protocols
