name: CTR
full_name: Counter Mode
category: mode
description: |
  CTR (Counter) mode turns a block cipher into a stream cipher by encrypting a counter value
  and XORing the result with the plaintext. It supports parallel encryption and random access.

parameters:
  block_size: 128
  nonce_size: 96
  counter_size: 32

properties:
  - stream_cipher_mode
  - parallelizable
  - random_access
  - no_padding_required
  - seekable

performance:
  software_speed: very_high
  hardware_speed: very_high
  memory: very_low
  power: low

security:
  security_level: 256  # Security depends on underlying cipher (AES-256)
  best_attack: none_practical
  attack_complexity: "Cipher-dependent, nonce reuse catastrophic"
  status: secure
  standardized: true
  proven_security: true

implementation_notes: |
  - Nonce/IV must NEVER be reused with the same key
  - Recommended to use a 96-bit nonce + 32-bit counter
  - Fully parallelizable for encryption and decryption
  - Does not provide authentication - use with HMAC or AEAD
  - No padding required - works with any plaintext length
  - Excellent for random access (e.g., disk encryption)
  - Counter overflow must be prevented
  - Consider GCM or CCM for authenticated encryption
