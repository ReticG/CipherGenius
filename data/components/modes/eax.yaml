description: |
  EAX is a two-pass authenticated encryption mode with provable security.
  It combines CTR mode with CMAC for authentication and is patent-free.

parameters:
  block_size: 128
  nonce_size: variable
  tag_size: 128

properties:
  - authenticated_encryption

implementation_notes: |
  - Nonce can be any length (unlike GCM)
  - Uses CMAC for authentication
  - Requires two passes over data
  - No special hardware requirements
  - Patent-free alternative to OCB
  - Simpler than GCM but less widely adopted
  - Not parallelizable
  - Supports associated data authentication
