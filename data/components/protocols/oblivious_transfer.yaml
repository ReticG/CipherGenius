name: Oblivious Transfer
full_name: 1-out-of-2 Oblivious Transfer Protocol
category: protocol
description: |
  Oblivious Transfer (OT) is a fundamental cryptographic protocol where a sender transfers
  one of multiple pieces of information to a receiver, but remains oblivious as to which
  piece was transferred. The receiver learns only one piece without learning anything about others.

parameters:
  variant: 1-out-of-2 # or 1-out-of-n
  security_model: semi_honest_or_malicious
  extension: supported # OT extension for efficiency
  message_size: variable

properties:
  - privacy_preserving
  - sender_oblivious
  - receiver_privacy
  - foundational_primitive
  - extensible

performance:
  setup_cost: high # public key operations

implementation_notes: |
  - Foundation for many MPC protocols
  - OT extension reduces expensive public key operations
  - Base OTs: ~100-1000 using public key crypto
  - Extended OTs: millions using only symmetric crypto
  - 1-out-of-2 OT: sender has m0, m1; receiver gets m_b
  - Receiver's choice bit b remains private
  - Sender doesn't learn which message was chosen
  - Critical component in garbled circuits
  - Random OT variant for better efficiency
  - Correlated OT for specific applications
  - Post-quantum variants exist (lattice-based)
