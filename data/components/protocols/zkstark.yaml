full_name: Zero-Knowledge Scalable Transparent Argument of Knowledge
category: protocol
description: |
  zkSTARK is a zero-knowledge proof protocol that requires no trusted setup and offers
  post-quantum security. It provides transparent, scalable proofs using collision-resistant
  hash functions. Used in StarkNet and other Layer 2 scaling solutions.

implementation_notes: |
  - No trusted setup required (transparent)
  - Post-quantum secure based on collision-resistant hashing
  - Larger proof sizes compared to SNARKs
  - Verification time grows logarithmically with computation
  - More efficient for very large computations
  - Uses FRI (Fast Reed-Solomon Interactive Oracle Proofs)
  - Excellent for blockchain scalability solutions
  - Proof size: O(log^2 n) where n is computation size
