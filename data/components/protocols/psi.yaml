full_name: Private Set Intersection
category: protocol
description: |
  Private Set Intersection allows two or more parties to compute the intersection of their
  private sets without revealing any information about elements not in the intersection.
  Enables privacy-preserving data matching and comparison.

parameters:
  parties: 2-N # number of parties
  set_size: scalable # depends on protocol variant
  security_model: semi_honest_or_malicious
  communication_rounds: variable # 1-3 rounds typical

properties:
  - privacy_preserving
  - set_intersection
  - multi_party_capable
  - size_hiding_variants
  - threshold_variants

performance:
  computation: medium
  communication: medium_to_high
  setup_cost: medium
  scalability: high # millions of elements
  memory: medium

security:
  security_level: 128
  best_attack: none_practical
  attack_complexity: "OWF_DDH_or_OT_assumption"
  status: secure
  standardized: false
  proven_security: true
  quantum_resistant: false # standard variants

compatible_with:
  - contact_discovery
  - private_matching
  - secure_analytics
  - compliance_checking
  - threat_intelligence

not_compatible_with:
  - public_intersection_required
  - real_time_streaming # typically batch

use_cases:
  - contact_discovery
  - private_matching
  - fraud_detection
  - threat_intelligence_sharing
  - ad_conversion_measurement
  - genetic_data_matching
  - compromised_credential_checking

not_recommended_for:
  - public_intersection
  - very_small_sets # overhead not worth it
  - continuous_streaming_data

implementation_notes: |
  - Multiple protocol variants: OT-based, DH-based, circuit-based
  - OT-based PSI: efficient for unbalanced set sizes
  - DH-based PSI: efficient for balanced sets
  - Circuit-based PSI: flexible but slower
  - Communication: O(n) for n elements in smaller set
  - Supports cardinality-only output (PSI-CA)
  - Labeled PSI: also transfer associated data
  - Threshold PSI: only reveal if intersection > threshold
  - Used in Signal, WhatsApp for contact discovery
  - Unbalanced PSI optimizations for server-client scenarios
  - Consider homomorphic encryption variants for labeled PSI
