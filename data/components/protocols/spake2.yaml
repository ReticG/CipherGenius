name: SPAKE2+
full_name: Simple Password-Authenticated Key Exchange (SPAKE2 Plus)
category: protocol
description: |
  SPAKE2+ is an efficient password-authenticated key exchange protocol that provides
  mutual authentication with forward secrecy. It is a symmetric PAKE suitable for
  device pairing and secure communication establishment based on shared passwords.

parameters:
  variant: SPAKE2plus
  curve: P256_P384_P521_Ed25519
  hash: SHA256_or_SHA512
  rounds: 1 # single simultaneous exchange

properties:
  - password_authentication
  - forward_secrecy
  - mutual_authentication
  - single_round
  - efficient

performance:
  key_exchange: fast
  computation: low # 2-3 scalar multiplications
  communication: low # 2 group elements
  server_storage: low
  memory: low

security:
  security_level: 128

implementation_notes: |
  - Standardized in RFC 9383 (2023)
  - Single simultaneous message exchange (very efficient)
  - SPAKE2+ is augmented version (asymmetric, server stores verifier)
  - Used in Matter (smart home) protocol for device commissioning
  - Supports multiple elliptic curves: P-256, P-384, Ed25519, Ed448
  - Forward secrecy through ephemeral Diffie-Hellman
  - Does not protect against server compromise (unlike OPAQUE)
  - Excellent for device pairing scenarios
  - Constant-time implementation important
  - Hash-to-curve for random oracle instantiation
  - Simpler and faster than SRP or OPAQUE
  - Ideal for IoT and constrained devices
