full_name: Groth16 zkSNARK Protocol
category: protocol
description: |
  Groth16 is the most efficient zkSNARK protocol in terms of proof size and verification time.
  It produces the smallest proofs and fastest verification but requires a circuit-specific
  trusted setup. Widely used in production systems like Zcash and Filecoin.

parameters:
  proof_size: 128 # bytes, constant (3 group elements)
  verification_time: constant
  setup_type: circuit_specific_trusted
  proof_type: non_interactive

properties:
  - zero_knowledge
  - minimal_proof_size
  - fastest_verification
  - circuit_specific_setup
  - non_interactive
  - pairing_based

performance:
  proof_generation: fast
  proof_verification: very_fast
  proof_size: minimal
  setup_cost: high # per-circuit setup
  memory: medium

implementation_notes: |
  - Most efficient zkSNARK in proof size and verification
  - Proof size: exactly 3 group elements (~128 bytes)
  - Verification: 1 pairing equation
  - Requires circuit-specific trusted setup
  - Setup ceremony must be repeated for each circuit
  - Widely battle-tested in production
  - Used in Zcash, Filecoin, Tornado Cash
  - Optimal for fixed circuits in production
  - Not suitable for frequently updated circuits
  - Prover time: O(n log n) for n gates
