name: GG20
full_name: Gennaro-Goldfeder 2020 Threshold ECDSA
category: protocol
description: |
  GG20 is a threshold ECDSA protocol that enables distributed key generation and signing
  without ever reconstructing the private key. It provides t-out-of-n threshold signatures
  where any t parties can collaboratively sign without revealing individual shares.

parameters:
  threshold: configurable # t parties needed to sign
  total_parties: configurable # n total parties
  rounds: 9 # signing rounds
  protocol_type: threshold_signature

properties:
  - threshold_signature
  - distributed_key_generation
  - no_trusted_dealer
  - ecdsa_compatible
  - proactive_security

performance:
  key_generation: slow
  signing: medium # 9 rounds
  verification: fast # standard ECDSA
  communication: high
  memory: medium

security:
  security_level: 128
  best_attack: none_practical
  attack_complexity: "discrete_log_assumption"
  status: secure
  standardized: false
  proven_security: true
  quantum_resistant: false

compatible_with:
  - bitcoin
  - ethereum
  - ecdsa_blockchains
  - custodial_wallets
  - key_management_systems

not_compatible_with:
  - post_quantum_scenarios
  - low_latency_requirements
  - offline_signing_only

use_cases:
  - cryptocurrency_custody
  - distributed_wallet_management
  - threshold_signatures
  - key_management
  - multi_party_authorization
  - secure_signing_services
  - institutional_crypto_custody

not_recommended_for:
  - high_frequency_signing
  - post_quantum_security
  - single_round_protocols

implementation_notes: |
  - No trusted dealer required (DKG protocol)
  - Compatible with standard ECDSA verification
  - 9 rounds for signing protocol
  - Secure against malicious adversaries
  - Supports proactive security (share refresh)
  - Identifiable abort: can detect malicious parties
  - Used in production by major crypto custodians
  - Higher communication complexity than Schnorr alternatives
  - Signature indistinguishable from standard ECDSA
  - Supports key resharing and recovery
  - Memory requirements scale with number of parties
