name: zkSNARK
full_name: Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge
category: protocol
description: |
  zkSNARK is a zero-knowledge proof protocol that allows one party to prove they possess certain
  information without revealing that information. It provides succinct proofs that are fast to verify.
  Used extensively in blockchain privacy solutions like Zcash.

implementation_notes: |
  - Requires trusted setup ceremony (Common Reference String)
  - Setup must be performed once per circuit
  - Toxic waste from setup must be destroyed
  - Proof generation is computationally expensive
  - Verification is constant time regardless of computation size
  - Circuit-specific setup required
  - Use Groth16 for most efficient proofs
  - Consider zkSTARK for transparent setup
