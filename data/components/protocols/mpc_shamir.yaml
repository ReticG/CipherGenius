description: |
  Shamir's Secret Sharing is a threshold cryptography protocol that divides a secret into
  multiple shares, where a minimum threshold of shares is required to reconstruct the secret.
  Based on polynomial interpolation, it provides information-theoretic security.

parameters:
  threshold: configurable # minimum shares needed
  total_shares: configurable # total shares created
  field_size: 256 # bits, typically matches secret size
  scheme_type: threshold

properties:
  - information_theoretic_security
  - threshold_cryptography
  - perfect_secrecy
  - verifiable_variant_available
  - share_homomorphic

performance:
  share_generation: fast
  secret_reconstruction: fast
  share_size: equal_to_secret
  computation: low
  memory: low

security:
  security_level: 256  # Information-theoretically secure, using 256-bit field
  best_attack: none_possible
  attack_complexity: "information_theoretically_secure"
  status: secure
  standardized: false
  proven_security: true
  quantum_resistant: true

compatible_with:
  - key_management
  - distributed_systems
  - threshold_signatures
  - secure_multiparty_computation
  - backup_recovery

not_compatible_with:
  - online_secret_usage # requires reconstruction
  - untrusted_combiners

use_cases:
  - distributed_key_management
  - secure_backup
  - threshold_signatures
  - access_control
  - disaster_recovery
  - multi_party_authorization
  - cryptocurrency_wallets

not_recommended_for:
  - frequent_secret_access
  - untrusted_reconstructors
  - dynamic_threshold_changes

implementation_notes: |
  - Based on polynomial interpolation over finite fields
  - k-out-of-n threshold: any k shares can reconstruct secret
  - Information-theoretically secure: < k shares reveal nothing
  - Each share is same size as the secret
  - Verifiable Secret Sharing (VSS) variant prevents dealer cheating
  - Use Feldman VSS for verifiability
  - Suitable for master key backup
  - Can be combined with MPC for threshold signatures
  - Homomorphic: shares can be added/multiplied
  - Ensure secure random polynomial coefficients
