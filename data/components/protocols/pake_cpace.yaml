full_name: Composable Password-Authenticated Connection Establishment
category: protocol
description: |
  CPace is a balanced password-authenticated key exchange protocol designed for simplicity
  and security. It is a CFRG (Crypto Forum Research Group) PAKE that provides strong
  security guarantees with a clean, composable design.

parameters:
  variant: CPace
  curve: ristretto255_P256_P384_P521
  hash_to_curve: elligator_or_sswu
  rounds: 1 # single simultaneous exchange

properties:
  - password_authentication
  - balanced_pake
  - forward_secrecy
  - composable_security
  - hash_to_curve_based

implementation_notes: |
  - CFRG standardized in RFC 9382 (2023)
  - Balanced PAKE: both parties have same role
  - Single simultaneous message exchange
  - Strong composability guarantees in UC model
  - Hash-to-curve is central to security
  - Supports Ristretto255, P-256, P-384, P-521
  - Elligator or SSWU hash-to-curve methods
  - Simpler than SPAKE2+ with similar efficiency
  - Excellent security proof and analysis
  - Suitable for peer-to-peer scenarios
  - Not augmented (both parties know password)
  - Post-quantum variants under research
  - Channel ID binds key exchange to application
  - Session ID for channel binding
