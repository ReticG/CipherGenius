name: SRP
full_name: Secure Remote Password Protocol
category: protocol
description: |
  SRP is a password-authenticated key exchange protocol that allows a user to authenticate
  to a server using a password without sending the password over the network. It provides
  mutual authentication and protection against dictionary attacks even if the server is compromised.

parameters:
  version: SRP-6a
  group_size: 1024-8192 # bits, safe prime modulus
  hash: SHA256_or_SHA512
  rounds: 2 # client and server exchange

properties:
  - password_authentication
  - zero_knowledge_proof
  - mutual_authentication
  - dictionary_attack_resistant
  - no_plaintext_transmission

performance:
  registration: fast
  login: medium # modular exponentiation
  server_storage: low
  client_computation: medium
  memory: low

security:
  security_level: 128 # depends on group size
  best_attack: none_practical
  attack_complexity: "discrete_log_assumption"
  status: secure
  standardized: true
  proven_security: true
  quantum_resistant: false

compatible_with:
  - tls_srp
  - apple_homekit
  - authentication_systems
  - iot_devices
  - legacy_systems

not_compatible_with:
  - post_quantum_scenarios
  - very_low_power_devices
  - hardware_accelerated_only

use_cases:
  - password_authentication
  - iot_device_pairing
  - secure_login
  - client_server_authentication
  - homekit_accessories
  - vpn_authentication

not_recommended_for:
  - post_quantum_security
  - new_protocol_design # consider OPAQUE
  - minimal_computation_devices

implementation_notes: |
  - Standardized in RFC 2945 and RFC 5054
  - SRP-6a is the current recommended version
  - Server stores verifier v = g^x, not password
  - Client proves knowledge of password without revealing it
  - Resistant to dictionary attacks even with server compromise
  - Requires modular exponentiation (slower than DH)
  - Choose large safe prime groups (2048+ bits recommended)
  - Used in Apple HomeKit for device pairing
  - TLS-SRP extension available but not widely adopted
  - Consider migrating to OPAQUE for new systems
  - Quantum vulnerable due to discrete log assumption
  - Simpler than OPAQUE but older design
