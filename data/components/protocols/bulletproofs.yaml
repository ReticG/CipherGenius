full_name: Bulletproofs (Short Non-Interactive Zero-Knowledge Proofs)
category: protocol
description: |
  Bulletproofs are short non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs that require no trusted setup.
  They are particularly efficient for range proofs and are used in Monero and other privacy-focused
  cryptocurrencies to prove values are within valid ranges without revealing the actual values.

implementation_notes: |
  - No trusted setup required
  - Proof size logarithmic in number of range proofs (aggregation)
  - Single range proof: ~1.3 KB
  - Verification time linear in proof size
  - Excellent for range proofs in confidential transactions
  - Uses Pedersen commitments
  - Inner product argument for efficiency
  - Batch verification possible for multiple proofs
  - Used in Monero since 2018
